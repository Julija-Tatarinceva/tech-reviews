        <h2>Overview of the Varmilo Pink Keyboard VA87MR Sakura</h2>
        <p>
            So, the Varmilo pink keyboard (va87mr) is a keyboard in TKL format, i.e. without a numpad. The switches used in my version are cherry mx red, the stabilizers are also cherry type. The keypack profile is also cherry type.

            In use, this is a very pleasant keyboard, with top-end cherry mx red switches, with good lubricated stabilizers, a beautiful design and thick and durable pbt keycaps, the symbols on which are applied using the sublimation method, due to which there will be no situation where the lettering on the keyboard can be erased.

            <br><br>

            The disadvantages include the lack of noise insulation between the plate and the keyboard body, because of this, the metal plate resonates a little when typing and a small metallic hum is heard.

            And also the lube on the stabilizers, especially on the space bar, dried out, and now the stabilizer has an unpleasant noise of the bracket (as if it was not lubricated)

            At that time, all keyboards from popular brands Logitech, HyperX, Razer had unlubricated stabilizers, because of which the bracket in the stabilizer rattled from the beginning, while in the varmilo va87mr it began to rattle after several years of use.

            The keyboard is completely functional to this day and everything is fine with it.

        <h3>Key Features of the Varmilo Pink Keyboard</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cherry MX Red linear switches for smooth, silent typing</li>
            <li>PBT keycaps with sublimated legends to prevent fading</li>
            <li>Custom Sakura pink backlighting enhancing the keyboard aesthetics</li>
            <li>Tenkeyless design for ergonomic desk space optimization</li>
            <li>Sturdy build with minimal flex and premium stabilizers</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Premium build quality, beautiful sakura pink design, long-lasting PBT keycaps, smooth Cherry MX Red switches.</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Initial shipment errors (no backlighting, standard switches), slight metallic hum from the plate, stabilizer squeak over time.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
        To summarize the review, the keyboard was very good for its time and was ahead of competitors from mass market brands such as HyperX, Razer, Steelseries, Logitech and others, providing much better quality for the same money than the above-mentioned manufacturers offered.
